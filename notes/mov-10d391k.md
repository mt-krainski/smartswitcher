# MOV-10DxxxK Series

Vristor protects against overvoltage transients such as lightning, power contact and power induction.

Varistors work similarly to a Zenner diode for alternating voltages. When the voltage reaches a certain level, the component starts conducting current, effectively keeping the voltage at a chosen level.

MOV-10D391KTR has max continuous voltage of 250 V AC.
