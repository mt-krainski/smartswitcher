# ACS723

Analogue output current sensor. Has multiple variants with regard to current capabilities. Measures current in both directions with 20/80kHz sampling rate. Based on Hall effect, part on which the current is sensed is galvanically isolated from the rest of the chip, with up to 2.4kV RMS.

Works with 4.5-5.5 V.
